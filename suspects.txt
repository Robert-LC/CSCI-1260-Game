Son Steve/Man in his early 20's, son to Momma Margaret and Daddy Dan, fraternal twin brother to Daughter Delilah. He is dressed in a suit so high caliber its something Barney Stinson would be jelous of, but his sense of style doesn't lend well to his nervous pacing back and forth around the room.
Butler Billy/Balding young chap, has a nice suit, serves your every need.
Chef Boyardee/He looks like he never has a napkin when he needs one.
Librarian Lily/Woman in her early thirties, has her hair tied up in a bun, and is wearing a white button up teeshirt, tucked into a black dress with a red cardigan keeping her warm. Every so often she has to push up her glasses. Her smile lights up your world, but you have your suspicisons.
Gardener Garret/Middle aged guy, Is bald but has a pretty unwrangly red beard. Seems like he's always angry.
Momma Margaret/Older woman, married to Daddy Dan and mother of Son Simon, she seems uptight but tries to distract herself.
Daddy Dan/Older man, maried to Momma Margret and father of Son Simon. The blank look on his face makes you think he has seen some stuff in his lifetime.
Daughter Delilah/Woman in her early 20's, daughter to Momma Margaret and Daddy Dan, fraternal twin sister to Son Steve. She is dressed in a sundress with an intricate design of flowers. She has flowy and slightly curly brown hair. She seems unaffected by your presence, almost as if you aren't even there.
