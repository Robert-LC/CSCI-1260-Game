Library/The library is one of the more old-fashioned rooms of the mansion. Lined top tobottom with shelves, the library is filled with thousands of novels purchased from all parts of the world. Beautifully clear windows peer over the garden, allowing an abundance of sunlight to fill the room. The library remains mostly untouched, as the mansion’s owners use it more as a collection room than an active library. Every now and again, members of the mansion may stop by, but for the most part, the room is left alone./Garden/Main Hall
Garden/The garden is probably one of the most beautiful parts of the mansion; it is filled with rows upon rows of flowers and other brightly colored plants. A specific portion of it is also dedicated to a butterfly garden that guests are welcome to walk through and enjoy. The area is used for a variety of events, mostly small parties, lunches, and other gatherings. Many members of the mansion stroll through the garden and take advantage of all the beauty it has to offer./Library
Closet/Dark and dim./Bedroom 
Main Hall/The great hall is a rectangular room between two timesas long as it was wide, with the ceiling hanging cavernously overhead. The walls were a mix of fine wood paneling, dotted with the occasional window. A breezy draft was coming through one of the windows, which had been shattered at some point during the night. Decorating the vast hall was an array of chandeliers,tapestries, and other no doubt expensive antiquities.Towards the rear of the hall was a grand staircase wrapping up and around thick marble pillars. In a shadowy nook, seemingly hidden away near the staircase was a relatively undecorated door, with a small placard above reading ‘Basement’. There were three other identically decorated doors leading out of the hall, two on the main floor and one at the top of the stairs. The ground floor doors lead to the Kitchen and Dining Hall while the stairs led to the Bedroom./Kitchen/Library/Bedroom/Basement
Kitchen/As you walk into the kitchen you notice the Chef standing by the two stoves presumably cooking up something. The appliances are notably outdated but seem to be kept well maintained. While looking around you notice a knife sitting out on one of the counters that seems dirty./Dining Room/Main Hall
Bathroom/Smells bad./Bedroom
Dining Hall/As you walk into the dining room you notice a large oak dining table ready to seat several guests. The silverware looks to bemade of pure silver and is polished very well. Up above sits a chandelier sparkling in the light. Among the empty glassware on the table, you notice a bottle that has liquid in it./Kitchen
Basement/When a house is built with love, the first evidence of such is in the solid construction of the basement, and this house was the worst example you’d seen in quite some time. The walls were gray and drab, built of quarried stone. There was seemingly an unidentifiable ooze dripping down the walls, which pooled grotesquely in the corner of the room. The slight slant in the floor made it feel as if you were constantly in danger of falling over, and never sure of your footing. The dim lighting didn’t help with the situation either, all light either coming from the door you’d left slightly ajar on your trip down here, or the single naked bulb hanging in the middle of the room. Understandably, there was no one present in the basement other than you. In the gloom you can make out various crates, boxes and shelves roughly stacked together./Main Hall
